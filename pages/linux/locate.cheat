# Look for pattern in the database. Note: the database is recomputed periodically (usually weekly or daily)
locate <pattern>

# Look for a file by its exact filename (a pattern containing no globbing characters is interpreted as `*pattern*`)
locate '*/<filename>'

# Recompute the database. You need to do it if you want to find recently added files
